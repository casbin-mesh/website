# Install with Binary

You can download the client and server binaries on our Github releases page. There is currently no installer available. You have to add the Casbin Mesh binary to the PATH in your environment yourself, for example by putting it into /usr/local/bin or something comparable.

Once installed, you should be able to run:

```bash
$ casbin-mesh help
```
